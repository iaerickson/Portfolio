				<p>
					Ian Erickson, who appears as himself, makes his web-development
					website debut with this "Space Jam" inspired portfolio. Widely
					considered a favorite in his class, Ian has parlayed an amazing
					Northwestern University full stack wed web-development certificate
					into an incredible opportunity for potential employers and companies
					alike. Hiring Ian Erickson to work for you or on your next project
					would be a real "slam dunk".
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					During his schooling, Ian often stood out from many of his peers with
					his design and aesthetic when it came to many of the front end-choices
					for his projects, while also taking up important backend and
					server-related roles, primarily for the Take-2 movie app and the
					Atlas-Video app.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Ian's passion for creativity, logic, and design is evident in all of
					his work, so why don't you take a look at the projects or his resume?
