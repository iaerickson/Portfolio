				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img

					class="auth-image"
					alt="Handsome Picture of Ian Erickson"
				/>
				<p>
					Ian Erickson, who appears as himself, makes his web-development
					website debut with this "Space Jam" inspired portfolio. Widely
					considered a favorite in his class, Ian has parlayed an amazing
					Northwestern University full stack web-development certificate into an
					incredible opportunity for potential employers and companies alike.
					Hiring Ian Erickson to work for you or on your next project would be a
					real "slam dunk".
				</p>
				<p>
					During his schooling, Ian often stood out from many of his peers with
					his design and aesthetic when it came to many of the front end-choices
					for his projects, while also taking up important backend and
					server-related roles, primarily for the Take-2 movie app and the
					Atlas-Video app.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ian's passion for creativity, logic, and design is evident in all of
					his work, so why don't you take a look at the projects or his resume?
				</p>

				<p>
					WAYNE KNIGHT (Stan Podolak) is probably best known for his role in the
					blockbuster "Jurassic Park," as well as for his recurring part as
					Newman, Jerry Seinfeld's postal carrier neighbor on the hit NBC series
					"Seinfeld." However, while he does appear in the movie Space Jam, he
					does not appear on Ian Erickson's website, besides being featured here
					in this paragraph, which was only included to draw further allusion to
					the Space Jam Website, under Parody Law and Fair Use (citation
					needed).
